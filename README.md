# libft

Second project in the coding school Hive where you were tasked to create a library of functions that are going to be used in later projects.
Some of the functions were already part of standard libraries and you are supposed to recreate to gain deep understanding how they actually work.

Due to strict rules and restrictions the following were mandatory in the creation of the functions:

- One function is limited to maximum of 25 lines
- Only the following libc functions were allowed : malloc(3), free(3) and write(2),
  and their usage were restricted. This creates the actual challenge of creating the functions.
- The functions have to abide with the 'Norme' (https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/733/norme.en.pdf). Which is a set of rules and guidelines to keep the code clear
  and readable.
  
  
### Standard funtions re-created:   
- memset
